                            Salloum co-led the Connecting to Congress (C2C) research team that received a grant from the
                            National Science Foundation (NSF) to work with the U.S. Congress on developing new
                            technology for constituent engagement. The C2C idea was that, in todayâ€™s society, it is hard
                            for individuals to feel like their voice is heard on important policies.

                        online town halls. This new, open source online town hall platform meets the requirements
                        identified in the extensive C2C research, and creates a setting for a many-participant,
                        interactive event that lends itself to collaborative, constructive exchanges between government
                        officials and constituents.

                        The C2C research team published their findings from the NSF study, Politics with the People:
                        Building a Directly Representative Democracy (Neblo, Esterling, and Lazer 2018). In it they give
                        recommendations for the design features that make for a good online town hall experience.

                        In particular, the online platform should reduce barriers to participating such that it is easy
                        for everyone in the community to participate interactively. The elected official should
                        participate in the session through streaming video and audio, so that the constituents can feel
                        the direct connection with the elected official and authenticate that it is in fact the elected
                        official with whom they are talking.
