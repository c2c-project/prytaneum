# Prytaneum Client

## Folder Design Philosophy

For folders inside of the `src/` directory on the client.

### **generated**/

These are types generated by relay for our graphql queries. Whenever importing from this folder, always use `import type`. See [type-only-imports docs.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html)

### animations/

Custom animations

### assets/

Static assets used by the web app.

### components/

React components that could be used in **any** part of the web app and are designed for general use. Some may have a slightly niche use case, but that does not prevent them from being used anywhere.

### features/

All components that are specific to a feature. A feature is made up of many components from the components/ folder, an external library, or one-off components.

#### features/core/

`features/core/` is noted because while it's not a feature in the same sense of `Events` or `Accounts`, it contains code core to the application, such as theme, relay code, and some React hooks.

### icons/

Sometimes the Material UI library doesn't quite have an icon that we need. So we get the SVG from https://materialdesignicons.com/ and make our own.

### layout/

Code specific to the layout of the webapp, such as the sidebar, main navigation, footer.

### pages/

Our routing folder. Nextjs is designed such that the structure of the `pages/` folder and subfolders correspond to the routes on our web app. See [Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

### utils/

Contains generic helper functions such as date formatting, error messages, etc.

## Future optimizations

-   [Bundle size analyzer](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/next-bundle-analyzer)
-   [Ensure that the babel.config.js does something](https://material-ui.com/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/#minimizing-bundle-size)

## TODO

-   smoothscroll-polyfill is not currently used, but needs to be properly intialized for at least the live page so safari scrolling works
