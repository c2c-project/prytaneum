Common things you would want to do and how to do them.

## View what's in the database?

[Use Prisma Studio](https://www.prisma.io/studio)

```
yarn workspace @app/server prisma studio
```

## Fix the lint error?

Usually when there's a lint error, there's a code associated with it. Mouse over the error and Google the specific error code. It should look something like `eslint/no-unused-variables`. The documentation should give you a better idea of how or what to change/fix.
