### Testing

1. [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) for E2E testing.

## Folder Design Philosophy

### Client

Folders contained with `app/client/src/`

#### \_\_generated\_\_/

These are types generated by relay for our graphql queries. Whenever importing from this folder, always use `import type`. See [type-only-imports docs.](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-8.html)

#### animations/

Custom animations

#### assets/

Static assets used by the web app.

#### components/

React components that could be used in **any** part of the web app and are designed for general use. Some may have a slightly niche use case, but that does not prevent them from being used anywhere.

#### features/

All React components that are specific to a feature. A feature is made up of many components from the components/ folder, an external library, or one-off components.

##### features/core/

`features/core/` is noted because while it's not a feature in the same sense as `Events` or `Accounts`, it contains code core to the application, such as theme, relay configuration, and some feature agnostic React hooks.

#### icons/

Sometimes the Material UI library doesn't have an icon that we need. So we get the SVG from [Material Design Icons](https://materialdesignicons.com/) and make our own.

#### layout/

Layout specific code for prytaneum, such as the sidebar, main navigation, and footer. Modifying code in this folder should be done with caution. It will affect every page in Prytaneum.

#### pages/

Nextjs is designed such that the structure of the `pages/` folder and subfolders correspond to the routes on our web app. See [Routing](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

#### utils/

Generic helper functions such as date formatting, error messages, etc.

### Server

Folders contained with `app/server/src/`

#### \_\_generated\_\_/

Generated typescript types for our database models. Generally, this folder does not need to be accessed since the prisma client will do that for us.

#### core/

Infrastructure and startup/shutdown related code.

#### features/

Feature specific code such as accounts and events.

#### lib/

Helper code that can be used anywhere in the application.
