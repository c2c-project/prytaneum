## Windows

-   When using Windows it is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to use WSL in order to avoid various issues. When using wsl for development, you may encounter issues accessing the web app via localhost. This issue should be fixed temporarily by restarting WSL with `wsl --shutdown`, and should be permanently fixed by turning off [Windows 10 Fast Startup](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4189-turn-off-fast-startup-windows-10-a.html).
